Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatial-temporal Focal Learning</h2>

# :house: STEV

## TLDR

## Data
This work contains three public datasets: EElectricity, EPeMS, and EWeather. 
To avoid leaking our information, you can find these datasets from the published work through the provided URL.
Notably, for the EPeMS dataset, you have to run two processing scripts. The first is to get the filter sensors and time ranges, 
then you can obtain the data for training, validating, and testing.

The Expanding-variant Time Series datasets are processed by the scripts (./data/scripts/).
